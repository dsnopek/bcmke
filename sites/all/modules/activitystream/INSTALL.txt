Installation
------------

 1. Extract the compressed download
 
 2. Upload the entire activitystream directory to your site's modules directory.
    (Don't know where to put it? sites/all/modules is a good choice.)
    
 3. Go to Admin -> Site Building -> Modules and activate the Activity Stream API
    and any plugin modules for it that you'd like to use.
    
Configuration
-------------
    
 1. Go to Admin -> Settings -> Activity Stream and configure any admin settings
    required by the plugin modules. For instance, to use Flickr, you'll need a
    Flickr API key from http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html
    
 2. Go to your profile and edit it to add your account information for each service
    you would like to use. Just click the Activity Stream tab to add your streams.
    
 3. Your stream will appear in your profile. It will also appear on a page by itself
    at http://example.com/stream/{your-user-id} and on a page with all other user's
    streams at http://example.com/stream
